review
"Terribly slow service. Can't lodge cheques in machine without your card. Offers v few services making it a fairly pointless branch, been caught out twice going there for stuff they can't do. No cashiers etc. Just people on site to explain what they can't do..."
Can‚Äôt even get in the door. The door man asks what you want and when he‚Äôs told to lodge money he tells you there is no lodgement machine. How are you supposed to put money in your account if there is no way to lodge it ?
Useless branch. No cash loadgement. No self service. AIB works not for people. I don‚Äôt recommend this branch.
They resolved my issue very quickly.
"It is only an ATM and account opening, you cannot cash checks or make deposits."
"I had a very good experience with Jenita, she was very attentive and helpful. I went to open an account and was able to get everything done quickly and she was very kind too! Give her a raise haha!"
"The bank it very professional and prompt üëå üëç üòé people there üòÄ they will help you with your personal information and many more ,it quick and that change there it in good üëç now it much easier. Thanks üòä"
Wasn't able to lodge a cheque or cash. What's the point of the branch. Had to go to the finglas branch.
Very bad service starting with the receptionist to the manager don't go there
Solo es cajero y apertura de cuentas no puedes cambiar cheques ni hacer dep√≥sitos
"Most pointless bank in the country... went in 6 months back to withdraw cash, was told its a cashless bank. Then today to lodge a cheque, told we do t have that facility here. What's the point"
I would give zero star but is not available. I went to the bank to ask for a refund and the attendant put me on the phone to claim my money back. They are supposed to do so. I am the client but they are acting as they are. This is crazy
Very helpful and efficient staff. I was able to finish opening an account within 30 minutes.
On hold for 15 minutes now answer how can you get an appointment
Please open the account
Worst bank ever. No cash facilities at all. Does this bank not realise that CASH STILL EXISTS. Not everyone has a card. Anyhow people are been charged transaction fees for using card so it‚Äôs cheaper to use cash. If this bank have no cash facilities then the bank should just close down. The public have to be offered card or cash facilities.
"If I could give 0 stars I would but seeing how hard the girl works and seeing what she has to deal with, I will leave the 1 star solely for her hard work.This branch has gone cashless with no prior warning. Needed to order a new bank card but needed money to tie me over to pay-day or till the new bank card arrives but they couldn‚Äôt give me my money because they are now cashless??! Utterly frustrating"

AIB CabraMost useless bank everCan't log money can't log checks ‚Ä¶
"I've been reluctantly banking with AIB for the last year, recently I've been trying to get a mortgage so I needed to request 6 months statements from 2 joint accounts I have with them. We've requested them 4 times at this stage, three times ‚Ä¶"
What kind of bank doesn‚Äôt take cash lodgements?
Incredibly rude service! I was hung-up on mid-sentence while trying to assist a client in opening a bank account. The employee was abrasive and had no time for my questions.
"Truly shocking to see how useless the entire building is, going completely cashless just adds a bunch of inconvenience to locals."
Worst customer service ever I was treated with more disrespect than I can express
"It used to be good bank. Now it's not a bank. No cash withdrawal facility except one ATM outside with limit 600e, no lodgement option too. Goverment try to digitalize our money and see every our transaction, control our life. AIB help them with it."
Horrible. No help one girl only that chooses who to answer. Machines don't work. Absolutely horrible .  Will defo move to another bank
Poor customer service... No cashier..
Joke !!!! No cash facility's
"Just when I thought they couldn't be more inconvenient, they removed the tills and ATMs from inside. I explained to them that I need to withdraw a sum exceeding the daily limit, which wasn't a problem prior this, I was advised to go to a local post office instead as they couldn't help me. While I'm at it I might as well go to Ulster bank down the road and open up an account there instead..."
"Went to my AIB Branch today to do a lodgement and speak to Customer service about a Direct Debit I didn't set up,The Security Guy wouldn't let me in the door because I wouldn't tell him the purpose of my visit in the street while in the Q, I told him i needed to speak to some one in side ( Which is None of his Business)Seriously AIB Cabra this is not good practice haven't to explain your private Banking Affairs to a Security Gaurd in Public and then for him to decide weather to let you in or not,I Also tried to call the branch but iv been on hold for over an hour but i had to go back to work,"

"Absolute rubbish. YOU CANT LODGE A CHECK, YOU CANT GET CASH. THIS IS NOT A BANK. THIS IS MORON CENTRAL."
The Terminal is almost every week for a couple of time out of service. I tried to get money once and the Terminal turned into out of service so I lost my card cause of technical problems! Be aware!
Very hard to get through to buy phone absolutely ridiculous service
Certain staff members are very rude
Like the Marie Celeste insideNo sign of staff to helpNo cash withdrawal facility except one ATM outside
You can‚Äôt lodge money here anymore ?? What‚Äôs the point in that
"Small, slow bank.Queue all the time"
"Waste of time, can't deposit or withdraw..AVOID"
Very unhelpful staff.
Fairly constant bank I have never  had any issues
People bery Bad service
Let you in just t tell you there's no counter
It's still open
