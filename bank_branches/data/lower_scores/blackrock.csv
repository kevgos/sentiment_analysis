review
What a waste of a bank. Needed to make a withdrawal and no cash facility or ATM. I was pointed across the road to the post office. No point in Banking with AIB when they can't offer the most basic of services
Great costumer service. Got my account swap application done in 2 minutes
"Woefully bad service. As a few others said here - what is the point in this branch? Went to open a savings account today, and ended up doing it ALL myself online in the branch. The guy I dealt with blamed being back from Holidays and no one had mentioned the new rates to him??!?"
Doesn’t:-lodge checks-help setup personal accounts (told to go online)-help setup business accounts (directed to go to Dun L or Stillorgan)I can see this ‘branch’ being replaced by an outdoor ATM and a phone number or a qr code that links you to the aib homepage/app store
"What a waste of space. Can’t lodge cash bad enough but you can’t even lodge a cheque at the ATM inside during opening hours! This is not a bank , possibly a mortgage broker but definitely not worthy of being called a bank."
Worst bank. They are “cashless”. Don’t bother going if you want to do the two most common things needed for a bank. Deposit or get cash. Absolutely ridiculous. Customer service is painfully slow too.
"I had an Alice in Wonderland experience in this bank as, despite having all necessary documentation, I could not carry out the transaction I required and was redirected to Stillorgan or Dunlaoghaire branches. I heard the 4 customers who followed me in as I was awaiting assistance receive the same advice, including advice to use the post office in Blackrock Shopping centre? Quite extraordinary and very frustrating. Staff were friendly and courteous, but what is the point if you cannot transact basic banking business?"
"The staff are not knowledgeable of their own products, are passive-aggressive, and fail to acknowledge the customer as a customer; instead they treat users of the branch as if they should be grateful for the privilege of banking with AIB.The number of times I have heard staff direct customers to the An Post in Blackrock Village Centre (inside Supervalu) is countless and unbelievable.Ciara, the assistant manager, is a stand out for her poor performance and aggressive treatment of customers; I saw this clearly in my own mother's dealings with her."
"I went in to open an account in the Blackrock branch with all the necessary documents. There was no other customers in the branch for the majority of my visit but after my details were taken, I was asked to wait for an invitation by email to make an appointment in 1.5 weeks for god knows when because they are so busy and don’t want to give unfair advantage to walk ins opening new accounts. Come on AIB, do better."
Getting phone support from an agent at AIB is harder than getting into Fort Knox or clearing the national debt. The level of service is appalling and when you do get through they can't help you. They are THE WORST BANK for customer service. Id didn't want to give any stars but it forced me to give one.
