review
"Awfully disgusting experience because of the staff called Lauren. Her behaviour was extremely rude and disrespectful. I wonder if was having a bad day or difficult time but this surely was not the way any normal banker behaves with clients.Only because of that person, I decided to get my account blocked and never do any deposit in AIB."
"Horrible service! My wife went there a few months back to open a new bank account. They told her to come back with a job offer letter or some proof to show a source of income but she didn't have a job back then. So we decided to wait till she did get a job. Last week she went there with a job offer letter and address proofs. They told her to come back with more address proofs. So today she went there with broadband bills from September to January. This time they said you need to give us original bills instead of printouts. So obviously we felt disgusted and decided to try in Bank of Ireland, Rathmines. She went there and was completely looked after. In and out within 45 mins with everything done. Avoid this branch and if possible this bank as well!"
"Bad service, especially the guy on the reception he has no idea what he's doing, rude, if u ask about anything he will try his best to make leave the branch. Useless branch and staff."
Update: LITERALLY CANNOT DEPOSIT A CHEQUE. What is the point of this branchAbsolutely clueless. Inexplicably unable to do basic banking services. Avoid this branch like the plague
What kind of bank doesn't take cash deposits or any kind of cash in general isn't that what a bank is they used to no idea why they changed it what a waste of space for a bank
Appalling service. Go to Baggot St Lower instead..
Incompetent people working in this branch!! I tried opening a bank account and was given a hard time!! They didn’t even explain anything. I left and went to another branch and opened an account in under 20 mins.
"Even if you think you can do your business with this ""cashless"" bank branch, i.e, something entirely not dealing with cash, don't be fooled. You can't even transfer your own money from your bank account to another - no cash is involved with this AIB!"
What’s the point of this branch if it doesn’t work with cash?
Never enough staff 1 TELLER on at 12:30
"Completely unuseful branch. You can’t deposit money, you can’t apply for financial products (they just provide you with a phone to call somewhere else). Honestly, don’t know for what purpose it exists."
Useless branch. Limited services and almost unstaffed.
Excellent service by Sophie! Very helpful and facilitating.
very slow not enouph staff
"Horrible service, they all treated me like garbage just because I had the deliveroo jacket, they didn't want to update my app because I was a delivery guy"
No longer does cash services. Pointless bank.
Fiona is the best! Very friendly and helped me to solve my problem!
Good customer service
"Two times my money lost in an international transaction. NO telephone, no email, no answer. Their mistake and I have to chase them to recover my money. Don´t open an account in this bank never"
It charge me the withdrawal and don't give me the money. It's the second time with the same issue in this ATM
"The staff are friendly, but it needs more staff.. Or better lodgement machines (see BOIs)."
needs more staff!!!!
"Don't waste your time going here! Understaffed....and by the time you eventually get seen by someone, you are then told that they can't help you and you need to visit a proper branch."
Excellent service from Maria Boix in this branch. I had an issue with my debit card that can only be solved in Galway as I opened my account there. Maria dealt with everything avoiding me the hassle of having to go to Galway!
No lodgements even on the atm machine
Great staff
The worst bank ever!!! Three moths to open an account!!! HORRÍVEL!!!
"Jenna and Rachel are amazing : nice, efficient, courteous.I'd never saw a such reception in a bank branches."
"The worst bank, they didn't help me to open a account"
"This is a cashless facility: you cannot lodge funds, and you can only withdraw cash from the ATM outside. It's only use is for talking to staff, it should not be listed as a bank."
30 minutes waiting for help for Mostar jinio I don’t know he give me a wrong name or
"Terrible branch, went to make a deposit in pounds and they questioned where I got the money from.After proving it, they were mad because the cash was not in order. Surreal experience"
Huge delays in closing an account
"It would be really helpful if AIB could add a note on Google that this branch has no cashiers. Wasted my time getting here, needed a cashier & then had to go elsewhere. This branch only has machines & customer service staff for consultations!"
Only one cashier at the cashdesk at lunch time...
The staff are very polite and will help you... but only two people helping you will stay a long time in the queue.I requested a statement of closed account and after three weeks I'm still …
No cashiers at this bank
