review
"Most pointless bank around, Go in to make a lodgement and you're told to go across to the post office. They can't help you with any day to day banking needs, avoid!"
Very good bank üèß they do help you out
"Can't lodge in money or take out, not to mention rude security guy and staff not friendly or helpful at all. Should close all together, because the staff there is completely appalling,  other branches are much more of a help and atleast smile to my face."

Opened a joint account with my wife. Excellent customer service. Completed during my lunch hour.
Super new AIB Bank branch located beside Gateway Student Village and Ballymun Garda Station. It is across the road from Supervalu. Its is only a 2 minute walk from Gateway Student Village.
No ATM and bad customer service again... Not recommended branch.
A bank branch where no banking can be done. Lodgements or withdrawals not possible.
Its the Branch with no use. Every query you will have same suggestion that It can be done online.
"One of the worst branches ever if it's not the worst, thank you for not doing your job"
