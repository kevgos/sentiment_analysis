review
"Impossible to phone them directly.  When I eventually did get someone to answer, they couldn't contact the branch because at 12.20pm they are closed for lunch?"
Now queueing for over 30 minutes withno end in sight. Only one person at counter
Always difficult to communicate with via the phone. Customer service is good within tthe branch but when you have to queue OMG aaaaaaaaaah
Machines always broken. Always a massive que. They just don't want to deal with customers at all.
Undefined person identifies him/her self as scribble works out of this branch.
Helpful fast ATM service
"I tried to pay the rent,the guy from giseu was very arrogantsent me to the machine even though there were no other clients to stay in linein one final I managed and I went to another bank"
Hate banks.  This one in particular the staff  I think could actually  have batteries installed. Operate like robots
At least they still handle cash
